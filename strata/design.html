                    <div>
                    	Facebook is a pretty mediocre website compared to others.  It has a lot of features which end up never being used because there are alternatives that are better.  It doesn’t have dark mode, and it doesn’t show posts in chronological order.  Creating an account is easy, and there aren’t that many technical issues, but it has many useless aspects.

                    <div>
                    	Youtube overall has a solid design.  It has a dark mode, and the orientation of everything is very smooth and neat.  The search bar is well placed and is always accessible, as it should be.  A very simple and solid design that assists the user, and doesn’t require any extra brainpower to operate.

                    <div> Reddit has a decent design overall.  It's overall pretty easy to make an account, however navigating the actual site can be obnoxious at times. Actually going through and finding what you want to find is not as easy as it should be, and it does have a dark mode, which is a plus.</div>

                    <div>I don't know I don't use Tumblr and creating an account was difficult so I chose not to put in the time especially since it's blocked on chromebooks</div>

                    <div>Overall, Twitter is above average.  It’s easy to navigate, easy to make an account for, and getting into the loop of things is very easy.  It has dark mode, which is always favored.  By default it shows you tweets from most recent, and that’s not changeable, which at times is frustrating.  The design is definitely good, but it’s nothing special.</div>

                    <div>The Huffington Post site is astoundingly mediocre.  There’s a large amount of content on your screen that’s poorly organized.  There’s no dark mode, and the website is very cluttered.  It’s easy to make an account, but hard to enjoy the design of the website.</div>

                    <div>It’s an alright website overall.  Definitely better than Huffington Post, but no dark mode, and the login system isn’t bad.  It’s much less cluttered than Huffington Post, and while they’re both similar it’s definitely better, but still nothing special.</div>
