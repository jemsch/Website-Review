            <h2>Our Method</h2>
            <p>
                The method used, was mainly research for how often accounts get hacked and if the site is encrypted. Also methods include looking into any features of the site that has to do with security reports or settings.

                    <div class="site-text-container-header"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a></div>
                    <div>Facebook is a fairly safe site. There is built in security uses SSL to automatically encrypt any data transmitted. Encryption is used to make it harder for anyone to access the account without  permission. Facebook is filled with anti invasion systems and you can do a security checkup to add more security. This will log you out of unused apps/browsers and notify you with alerts if there are any threats. Like any website, there are still dangers and it is possible for someone to hack into your account. Recently, alot of encrypted passwords were put into plain site by a subsidiary company of facebook. The issue was resolved but any of the employees could have had access to the passwords. If this wouldn’t have happened, the grade could have possibly been an A- but my conclusion is that it results in a C+.</div>

                    <div>At one point in April 2018, Vevo was hacked. Two hackers replace some video clips of popular music videos such as Despacito, with violent images and videos with title changes too. These hackers were than arrested. This isn't the only case of hackings into youtube accounts. Many accounts have been hacked before as a result of only being protected by your gmail account and with the correct information, getting access to someones channel without permission is possible. Youtube is not an encrypted site. Any place you log in to from your gmail account that is not encrypted, can lead to exposed data and log in info. Youtube collects information from what you search and how you use Google search. They also have your contact information and can collect data on location. Your interactions on Google Search may lead to targeted ads. Youtube is safe and is a trusted sight, although connections to outside sources can be found in descriptions and ads which could potentially be dangerous. Descriptions and ads with links and download files could possibly contain a virus. For these reasons,  I give Youtube a C+ in security. </div>

                    <div>In august 2018, reddit had an incident in security where a hacker managed to gain knowledge on data from users, such as emails and old passwords.. Any submitted content on Reddit such as  posts, messages, and comments is stored and will not be removed after your account is deleted. They collect data such as device information, IP address, browser type, location and cookies.  Reddit will have your information shared to third parties for the purpose of advertising but will not share browsing habits or anything private. Limited numbers of employees have access to your private information and will send security alerts if the account may be affected.  The grade Reddit deserves for security is a C+.</div>

                    <div>Tumblr uses account information for personalization.  They do not share passwords with third party services but will collect financial information (such as copyright methods) and credit card numbers. For using images, camera info is used. Tumblr offers a security page to report suspicious activity or any threats to your account. Tumblr users can encrypt visits to sites as an option but it is still debated in security as it is not a default setting. This setting should be put as default to prevent private information to be shown to people. Tumblr users have complained about hackings into their account. Malware has been embedded in a post in 2012 by a troll  group named GNAA. (Gay N*****  Association of America). This means that Tumblr is not completely safe. For these reasons, Tumblr receives a B- in grade.</div>

                    <div>In 2016, it was found that 32 million twitter accounts have been hacked and passwords were being sold on the dark web. This proves that twitter is not a completely safe site and has some flaws. With a limit to 140 characters per tweet, urls are often shortened. People may not know what the url they are clicking on will lead to, making it easier for hackers to send out dangerous links. It is easy to follow many users, and the more users you are in contact with, the more danger there is in online safety. It is easy for anyone to create a fake account, as there is is no confirmation with any email given. I conclude that the rating for Twitter’s security is a C.</div>

                    <div>HuffPost does not have  to be viewed with an account so which means anyone can view the content and not much information is given to the site besides the use of cookies. This site uses cookies for advertisers. If you were to make an account on huff po, there is no limit on how many devices are logged in on your account. The site itself is pretty safe but ads, however are not from the site itself and could possibly be dangerous by containing malware. I give the rating for security an A-.</div>

                    <div>Similar to HuffPost, this site does not require an account to be used to view their content. Like many sites, they use cookies for customized and relevant content. They could also share personal information with trusted advertisers. HuffPost can collect and analyze data from the actions taken on sight such as IP address, operating system, and more. By using the site, there is a risk that communication data can still be accessed by unauthorized third parties. This site also does not respond to “Do not track” requests that some internet browsers have. Lack of an account may make visits to this site safer but overall this site is pretty safe and deserves an A-.</div>
