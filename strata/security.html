            <h2>Our Method</h2>
            <p>
                The method used, was mainly research for how often accounts get hacked and if the site is encrypted. Also methods include looking into any features of the site that has to do with security reports or settings.

                    <div class="site-text-container-header"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a></div>
                    <div>Facebook is a fairly safe site. There is built in security uses SSL to automatically encrypt any data transmitted. Encryption is used to make it harder for anyone to access the account without  permission. Facebook is filled with anti invasion systems and you can do a security checkup to add more security. This will log you out of unused apps/browsers and notify you with alerts if there are any threats. Like any website, there are still dangers and it is possible for someone to hack into your account. Recently, alot of encrypted passwords were put into plain site by a subsidiary company of facebook. The issue was resolved but any of the employees could have had access to the passwords. If this wouldnâ€™t have happened, the grade could have possibly been an A- but my conclusion is that it results in a C-.</div>

                    <div>At one point in April 2018, Vevo was hacked. Two hackers replace some video clips of popular music videos such as Despacito, with violent images and videos with title changes too. These hackers were than arrested. This isn't the only case of hackings into youtube accounts. Many accounts have been hacked before as a result of only being protected by your gmail account and with the correct information, getting access to someones channel without permission is possible. Youtube is not an encrypted site. Any place you log in to from your gmail account that is not encrypted, can lead to exposed data and log in info. Youtube collects information from what you search and how you use Google search. They also have your contact information and can collect data on location. Your interactions on Google Search may lead to targeted ads. Youtube is safe and is a trusted sight, although connections to outside sources can be found in descriptions and ads which could potentially be dangerous. Descriptions and ads with links and download files could possibly contain a virus. For these reasons,  I give Youtube a C in security. </div>

                    <div>In august 2018, reddit had an incident in security where a hacker managed to gain knowledge on data from users, such as emails and old passwords.. Any submitted content on Reddit such as  posts, messages, and comments is stored and will not be removed after your account is deleted. They collect data such as device information, IP address, browser type, location and cookies.  Reddit will have your information shared to third parties for the purpose of advertising but will not share browsing habits or anything private. Limited numbers of employees have access to your private information and will send security alerts if the account may be affected.  The grade Reddit deserves for security is a C+.</div>

                    <div>Tumblr uses account information for personalization.  They do not share passwords with third party services but will collect financial information (such as copyright methods) and credit card numbers. For using images, camera info is used. Tumblr offers a security page to report suspicious activity or any threats to your account. Tumblr users can encrypt visits to sites as an option but it is still debated in security as it is not a default setting. This setting should be put as default to prevent private information to be shown to people. Tumblr users have complained about hackings into their account. Malware has been embedded in a post in 2012 by a troll  group named GNAA. (Gay N*****  Association of America). This means that Tumblr is not completely safe. For these reasons, Tumblr receives a B- in grade.</div>

                    <div>HuffPost does not have  to be viewed with an account so which means anyone can view the content and not much information is given to the site besides the use of cookies. This site uses cookies for advertisers. If you were to make an account on huff po, there is no limit on how many devices are logged in on your account. The site itself is pretty safe but ads, however are not from the site itself and could possibly be dangerous by containing malware. I give the rating for security an A-.</div>
